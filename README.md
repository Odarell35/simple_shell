In this project we are making the UNIX command line interpreter, also known as a shell, a program that provides a command line interface for interacting with the UNIX or UNIX-like operating systems. It is a textual interface where users can enter commands to execute various tasks and interact with the system.

The most common shell used in UNIX-like systems is the Bourne Again SHell (bash), but there are other shells available, such as the C Shell (csh), the Korn Shell (ksh), and the Z Shell (zsh), among others. Each shell has its own set of features and capabilities, but they all share the basic functionality of allowing users to enter commands and receive output from the system. simple basic shell. it will be able to read the commands of user input and also out put the given or expected results.
The project was composed in collaboration with Lerato Mawasha and  Sipho Mabirimise

The topics that we covered are as follows:

1. Writing a basic UNIX command line interpreter.
2. Handle command lines with arguments
3. Implemention of several builtin functions such as:
      exit
      env (displays enviroment variables)
      cd (change directory)
      alias (displays list of alias available)
